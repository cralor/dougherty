description: Ben "Ironman" Kraines is yet another well experienced and well established member of the Society. He pioneered a candidate training program that went on to win the LBJ cup, as well as became the baseline for a national training program. He also managed a $500 acquisition of equipment for training exercises. His keen attention to detail, fostered through ROTC as well as at an internship with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is essential for the demands of maintaining the national budget while providing assistance to the National Conclave Staff.
goal1title: Establish a Scholarship for NCLS at USAFA
goal1: If we are to be a continuously improving society, we must fund opportunities that enhance the knowledge of our membership. The National Character and Leadership Symposium held annually at the Air Force Academy is the kind of event we should be encouraging  our members to attend. By providing scholarships to defray the cost of attendance and registration, we can increase the access to the lessons taught at NCLS within our society. This will also allow for a small gathering of Arnies to be held at the Academy outside of an ARCON environment.
goal2title: Solicit Major Corporate Sponsorships for AAS
goal2: Actuating the connections that our 3,000 + society members have to solicit additional corporate sponsorship would only add to our capacity to serve the nation and our Air Force. Relationships formed at the fall Executive Board meeting within the Defense Industrial Complex this past year revealed a deep desire by a number of companies to support our society financially. Yet when these opportunities were pursued it was revealed that most budgets were set in stone before the start of the next fiscal year. By reaching out to organizations with close ties to airpower, we can begin to propose partnerships fostered by Arnies, for the Executive Management Center to consider.
goal3title: Increase the Number of NATCON Scholarships
goal3: With NATCON as our premier event, it is important that our members have the opportunity to apply for partial scholarships to defray the cost of attendance. By applying lessons learned from the 2014/2015 budget, we plan book ARCON and NATCON travel early and in coordination with the Dougherty Chapter (as they bid unopposed for Silver Wings National Staff) and use the funds saved toward NATCON Scholarships. Additionally, all miscellaneous funds not spent will be immediately moved to NATCON Scholarships.
