description: Gabe "Bobber" Piñeiro is the kind of guy everyone wants on their team. His commitment to excellence and willingness to voice the unpopular opinion makes him a key part of every organization he works with. As a member of the Squadron Support team, the Public Affairs Officer, as well as our CSCOP, he's has the widespread experience necessary to mentor squadrons needing development and evaluate awards to ensure our hardest workers are recognized by their fellow Arnies.
