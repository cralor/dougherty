description: Colin "Dz" Dziadaszek has been a hard charger since candidacy. As a brand new active member, he wrote awards packages that won the LBJ Cup and Badley Trophy. Colin plans to employ his experience as an Eagle Scout, Candidate Class Operations Officer, and National Director of Support to find opportunities for meaningful service. He has experience interfacing with CAP, Silver Wings, and the Air Force Association at the local and national levels which will enable him to hit the ground running!
goal1title: Use Hours Reporting for Service Trend Analysis
goal1: With the rollout of the online Squadron Monthly Report (SMR), we can now measure service, month to month compared to last yearâ€™s reliably recorded data via Digital Cheetah. At each echelon we can now answer whether or not we are on pace with the previous year, in general and per capita.
goal2title: Transition to Hours per Capita Model
goal2: Through the addition of Form 1 information to the SMR we can calculate the theoretical number of service hours per person. Now, as our society changes in size year to year we can set service goals that reflect a value performed by everyone, rather than focusing in on one set number to strive for nationally.
goal3title: 105,000 Service Hours / 30 Hours Per Capita
goal3: 105,000 is a reaching goal but one that would push our society to pre-2014 levels of service, which were done when we were larger. Our primary goal will be for each Arnie to perform at least 30 hours of service from NATCON to NATCON.
