goal1title: Create USAFA Commander’s Action Committee
goal1: The Executive Management Center and the 2014/2015 National Staff have worked with Lt Gen Johnson, the USAFA Superintendent, to lay the framework for the growth of Arnold Air Society membership at the Academy. A target was set at a quarter of the Cadet Wing, or about 1,000 cadets. As a society we must answer the essential question of how these Arnies will be represented at NATCON. Tom feels that a committee of National and Area leadership as well as Falcon Squadron members should evaluate the alternatives and prepare a resolution for the 2016 NATCON, allowing the general assembly to confront this impending question early. A few years from now when the goal has been met, there won’t be any question how we will represent an increased Academy presence.
goal2title: Grow Silver Wings
goal2: With over 120 Arnold Air Society squadron and under 60 Silver Wings Chapter in existence, it’s pretty clear we have some work to do. Silver Wings is an essential component to our society’s identity and to our service priorities. Civilian support of the military is of the utmost importance to our generation of officer candidates. By targeting the squadrons with the largest support base of civilians, we can lay the framework for starting Silver Wings Chapters where AAS already exists. Together we can help grow our organization and increase our capacity to serve our communities, and our Air Force.
goal3title: Unified Leadership with Silver Wings
goal3: With the Dougherty Chapter running unopposed for Silver Wings National Staff, an unprecedented level of communication and synergy will be possible if Dougherty Squadron is elected. The two bid teams have worked together closely to create goals that will spark growth for both our organizations. Together, we can move past working as separate societies and start thinking as one organization; as one team of airpower advocates.
